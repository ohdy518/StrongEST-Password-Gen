# What makes this generator the STRONGEST?
This code lets you to generate password like other generators... but with **emojis** included 🤣


So, instead of outputting `D1#4f3$dfkk%jlp]:.` for 18-letter password, It'll output `Z🎩W:9f3gm6:🎡🎬.🎤P🎮V`


This way, you can make an easy-to-remeber but more secure password


~~If you want to make an account that isn't accessible by ANYONE, I suggest you to make a 65536-char emoji password. Example in 65536.txt~~
